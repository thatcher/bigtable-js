To run dev server:

/path/to/appengine/bin/dev_appserver.sh /opt/webapps/bigtable-js/

you should now be able to see:

http://localhost:8080/rest/

to deploy to production (first make sure to point at your own app engine id in 
WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml)

/path/to/appengine/appcfg.sh update /opt/webapps/bigtable-js/

Currently we are only supporting AppEngine SDK 1.2.1, but it's only because
we havent had time to catch up.  You can help!

Good luck and have fun javascripting!
